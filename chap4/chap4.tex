Black hole - neutron stars (Bh-ns) inspirals and mergers are an important potential source of gravitaitonal waves for ground-based detectors like Advanced LIGO and Virgo. Information abou tthe inspiral can help determine the neutron star equation of state. Electromagnetic signals from the merger can give clues about the violent physical processes that occur. Gravitaitonal waves help test general relativity in the genuinely non-linear regime.

The parameter space of Bh-ns binaries is quite rich. The mass ratio, $q$, and black hole spin, $\vec{\chi}$, have been of particular interest in numerical simulations. Foucart \red{cite} gave an analytic description of how this combination can predict the time of neutron star disruption. The neutron star equation of state is also of great interest. The size of the star is directly lninked ot when tidla disruption occurs. One aspect that has not been studied, however, is the effect of neutron star spin. All simulations to date use irrotational neutron star in their Bh-NS binaries. Since no Bh-NS binaries have been directly observed, the NS spins are, at least observationally, unconstrained. Spinning NS will affect the gravitational waveforms and cause the inspiral to proceed more slowly (for spin-aligned NS). \red{cite} XX found that NS spins of XX in Bh-ns binaries could cause Advanced LIGO to miss XX percent of potential signals. The spin could also affect the time of NS disruption, as the stellar material will be less tightly bound to the stellar surface.

Recently, \cite{Tacik:2015tja} used the {\tt SpEC} code to create and
evolve initial data sets of binary neutron star systems with arbitrary
spins. In this chapter, we extend this code to create initial data for
Bh-ns systems where the NS spin is arbitrary. The structure of this
chapter is as follows: In section XX, we review the formalism
developed in \cite{Tichy:2011gw} to create binaries with spinning NS,
and discuss how this is extended to Bh-NS systems. In section XX we
present data demonstrating the robustness and convergence of this
initial data. Finally, we conclude the chapter in section XX.

\section{Initial Data Formalism}
In this section we will discuss the formalism used to solve the
Einstein field equations and create quasi-equilibrium initial data for
black-hole - neutron star (BHNS) binaries with spinning neutron
stars. We begin with the $3+1$ decomposition of the space-time metric
tensor,
\begin{equation}
g_{\mu}{\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu} = -\alpha^2dt^2 + \gamma_{ij}\left(dx^i +
  \beta^idt\right)\left(dx^j+\beta^jdt\right),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the lapse function, $beta^i$ is the shift vector,
and $\gamma_{ij}$ is the induced metric on a spatial hypersurface
$\Sigma(t)$. The normal vector $n^{\mu}$ to $\Sigma(t)$ is related to
the coordinate time $t$ by
\begin{equation}
t^{\mu} = \alpha n^{\mu} + \beta^{\mu}.
\end{equation}
The extrinsic curvature of $\Sigma(t)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
K_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}_n\gamma_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_{\mu\nu}=g_{\mu\nu}+n_{\mu}n_{\nu}.$ We restrict our
attention to the spatial part $K^{ij}$ of the extrinsic curvature,
since $n_{\mu}K^{\mu\nu}=0$ by construction. It is convenient to
decmopose it into its trace and trace-free parts,
\begin{equation}
K^{ij} = A^{ij}+\frac{1}{3}K\gamma_{ij}.
\end{equation}
The matter in the system is modelled with the stress-energy tensor of
a perfect fluid 
\begin{equation}
T_{\mu\nu}=\left(\rho+P\right)u_{\mu}u_{\nu}+Pg_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the fluid's energy density, $P$ is its pressure, and
$u^{\mu}$ is its four-velocity. It is further useful to define the
projections of the matter quantities
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=& T^{\mu\nu}n_{\mu}n_{\nu},\\
S &=& \gamma^{ij}\gamma_{i\mu}\gamma_{j\nu}T^{\mu\nu}, \\
J^i &=& -\gamma^{i}_{\nu}T^{\nu\tau}n_{\tau}.
\end{eqnarray}
The spatial metric is decomposed with the conformal transformation
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{ij}=\Psi^4\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}
\end{equation}
where $\Psi$ is called the conformal factor, and $\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}$
is the conformal metric. The other quantities in the initial value
problem use the following conformal transformations:
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=& \Psi^{-6}\tilde{E}, \\
S &=& \Psi^{-6}\tilde{S}, \\
J^i &=& \Psi^{-6}\tilde{J}^i, \\
A^{ij} &=& \Psi^{-10}\tilde{A}^{ij} \\
\alpha &=& \Psi^{6}\tilde{\alpha} 
\end{eqnarray}
$\tilde{A}^{ij}$ is related to the shift and to the time derivative of
the conformal metric, $\tilde{u}_{ij}=\partial_t\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}$,
by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{A}^{ij} =
\frac{1}{2\tilde{\alpha}}\left[\left(\tilde{\mathrm{L}}\beta\right)^{ij}-\tilde{u}^{ij}\right],
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{L}$ is the conformal longitudinal operator,
\begin{equation}
\left(\tilde{L}V\right)^{ij}=\tilde{\nabla}^iV^j + \tilde{\nabla}^jV^i
- \frac{2}{3}\tilde{\gamma}^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_kV^k.
\end{equation}
We solve the extended thing sandwich (XCTS), which are a set of 5
coupled non-linear equations.
\begin{eqnarray}
2\tilde{\alpha}\bigg[\tilde{\nabla}_j\left(\frac{1}{2\tilde{\alpha}}\big(\tilde{L}\beta\big)^{ij}\right)-\tilde{\nabla}_j\left(\frac{1}{2\tilde{\alpha}}\tilde{u}^{ij}\right) && \nonumber\\
\label{eq:XCTS-Shift}
-\frac{2}{3}\Psi^6\tilde{\nabla}^iK-8\pi\Psi^4\tilde{J}^i\bigg] &=&0,
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\nabla}^2\Psi - \frac{1}{8}\Psi\tilde{R} -
\frac{1}{12}\Psi^5K^2  \qquad\quad && \nonumber \\
\label{eq:XCTS-ConformalFactor}
+\frac{1}{8}\Psi^{-7}\tilde{A}_{ij}\tilde{A}^{ij} +
2\pi\Psi^{-1}\tilde{E} &=& 0,
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
&&\tilde{\nabla}^2\left(\tilde{\alpha}\Psi^7\right) -
\left(\tilde{\alpha}\Psi^7\right)\bigg[\frac{1}{8}\tilde{R}+\frac{5}{12}\Psi^4K^2+\frac{7}{8}\Psi^{-8}\tilde{A}_{ij}\tilde{A}^{ij}\nonumber \\
\label{eq:XCTS-Lapse}
&&+2\pi\Psi^{-2}\big(\tilde{E}+2\tilde{S}\big)\bigg]=-\Psi^5\left(\partial_{t}K
- \beta^{k}\partial_kK\right).
\end{eqnarray}
These are solved
for $\Psi$, the densitized lapse, $\alpha\Psi$, and the shift.

The matter content of $\Sigma(t)$ is determined by $\tilde{E}$,
$\tilde{S}$, and $\tilde{J}^i$. The free data are $\gamma_{ij}$,
$\tilde{u}_{ij}$, $K$ and $\partial_t K$. $\tilde{u}_{ij}=0$ and
$\partial_t K=0$ are natural choices in a coordinate system corotating
with the binary. We use the choice of maximal slicing, $K=0$. The
choice of the conformal metric will be later discussed in section XX.

Let us now further discuss the matter content of the neutron star. The
energy density of the fluid is $\rho=\rho_0\left(1+\epsilon\right)$,
where $\rho_0$ is the baryon density and $\epsilon$ is the internal
energy. The specific enthalpy of the fluid is
\begin{equation}
h=1+\epsilon+\frac{P}{\rho_0}.
\end{equation}
It is convenient to introduce the following projection of the four
velocity:
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma &=& \gamma_n\gamma_0\left(1-\gamma_{ij}U^iU^j_0\right) \\
\gamma_0 &=& \left(1 - \gamma_{ij}U^i_0U^j_0\right)^{-1/2} \\
\gamma_n &=& \left(1 - \gamma_{ij}U^iU^j\right)^{-1/2} \\
U^i_0 &=& \frac{\beta^i}{\alpha} \\
u^{\mu} &=& \gamma_n\left(n^u+U^\mu\right) \\
U^{\mu}n_{\mu}&=&0
\end{eqnarray}
Following \cite{Tichy:2011gw}, the three-velocity is written as the sum
of an irrotational part (the gradient of a potential $\phi$) and a
rotational part $W$:
\begin{equation}
U^i =
\frac{\Psi^{-4}\tilde{\gamma}^{ij}}{h\gamma_n}\left(\partial_j\phi+W_j\right).
\end{equation}
$W$ is a freely chosen vector in this formalism; we will discuss this choice in section XX.

The matter fluid must satisfy the continuity equation and the Euler equation. The continuity equation is a second order elliptic equation for the potential $\phi$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho_0}{h}\nabla^{\mu}\nabla_{\mu}\phi+\left(\nabla^{\mu}\phi\right)\nabla_{\mu}\frac{\rho_0}{h}=0.
\end{equation}
Under the assumptions made in \cite{Tichy:2011gw}, this equation can be written as
\begin{align}
\rho_0\,\bigg\{\!\!&-\tilde{\gamma}^{ij}\partial_i\big(\partial_j\phi+W_j\big)  + \frac{h\beta^i\Psi^4}{\alpha}\partial_i\gamma_n + hK\gamma_n\Psi^4 \nonumber\\
&\qquad+\Big[\tilde{\gamma}^{ij}\tilde{\Gamma}^k_{ij}+\gamma^{ik}\partial_i\big(\ln \frac{h}{\alpha\Psi^2}\big)\Big] 
\big(\partial_k\phi+W_k\big) \bigg\} \nonumber \\
&=\tilde{\gamma}^{ij}\big(\partial_i\phi+W_i\big)\partial_j\rho_0 - \frac{h\gamma_n\beta^i\Psi^4}{\alpha}\partial_i\rho_0.
\label{eq:Continuity}
\end{align}
The Euler equation is solved for the specific enthalpy $h$. The solution is, as shown in Tichy \red{cite}:
\begin{equation}
h = \sqrt{L^2 -
  \left(\nabla_i\phi+W_i\right)\left(\nabla^i\phi+W^i\right)},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
L^2 =
\frac{b+\sqrt{b^2-4\alpha^4\left(\left(\nabla_i\phi+W_i\right)W^i\right)^2}}{2\alpha^2},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
b =
\left(\beta^i\nabla_i\phi+C\right)^2+2\alpha^2\left(\nabla_i\phi+w_i\right)w^i.
\end{equation}

The boundary condition at the surface of the neutron star can deduced from the $\rho_0\rightarrow 0$ limit of the continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\gamma}^{ij}\left(\partial_i\phi+W_i\right)\partial_j\rho_0=\frac{h\gamma_n\beta^i\Psi^4}{\alpha}\partial_i\rho_0.
\end{equation}
The boundary condition at infinity (which is in practice, in our computational grid, at $R=10^{10}$) are the requirement of a Minkowski metric in the intertial frame:
\begin{eqnarray}
\beta^i&=&0,\\
\alpha\Psi &=& 1,\\
\Psi &=&1.
\end{eqnarray}
The interior of the black hole is excised from the computation domain. The boundary conditions at the surface of the black hole horizon are \red{cite}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:BhBoundary}
\tilde{s}^k\nabla_k\log\Psi&=&-\frac{1}{4}\left(\tilde{h}^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}^i\tilde{s}_j-\Psi^2J\right) \\
\label{eq:BhBoundary2}
\beta_{\perp}&=&\alpha \\
\label{eq:BhBoundary3}
\beta_{\parallel}&=&\Omega_{j}^{BH}x_k\epsilon^{ijk}
\end{eqnarray}
whre $s$ is the outward pointing unit normal to the apparent horizon
surface, A$h^{ij}$ is the 2-metric on the surface, $J$ is a projection
fo the excision surface \red{clarify this}, and $\Omega^{BH}$ is a
free parameter that determines the spin of the black hole.

The force balance equation at the centre of the NS is 
\begin{equation}
\nabla\log h=0.
\end{equation}
We can re-write this equaiton as 
 \begin{equation}
\label{eq:OmegaDriver}
\nabla\ln\left(\alpha^2-\gamma_{ij}\beta^{i}\beta^{j}\right)=-2\nabla\ln\Gamma,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Gamma
=\frac{\gamma_n\left(1-\left(\beta^i+\frac{W^i\alpha}{h\gamma_n}\right)\frac{\nabla_i\phi}{\alpha
    h\gamma_n}- \frac{W_i W^i}{\alpha^2\gamma_n^2}\right) } { \sqrt{ 1
    - \left(\frac{\beta^i}{\alpha}+\frac{W^i}{h\gamma_n}\right)
    \left(\frac{\beta_i}{\alpha}+\frac{W_i}{h\gamma_n}\right) } } .
\end{equation}, which is a second order equation for the orbital
frequency $\Omega$. If desired, this equation can be solved to find a
best guess for the orbital frequency. Alternatively, eccentricity
removal techniques, such as those used in \cite{Tacik:2015tja} can be
used to find the best value of the orbital frequency.

$W$ is chosen as as to give the NS a uniform rotational
profile. Following our work in \cite{Tacik:2015tja}, we use
\begin{equation}
W^i=\epsilon^{ijk}\omega^jr^k,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon^{ijk}=\{\pm1,0\}$, $r^k$ is the position vector relative to the centre of the star, and $\omega^j$ is a freely chosen constant vector.

The angular momentum of the black hole is computed as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:BhSpin}
S=\frac{1}{8\pi}\oint_{\mathcal{H}}\phi^is^jK_{ij}dA
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}$ is the black hole's apparent horizon, $s^j$ is the
outward-pointing unit-normal and $\phi^i$ is an azimuthal vector
field. The dimensionless spin is defined as
\begin{equation}
\chi=\frac{S}{M^2}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the Christodoulou mass
\begin{equation}
M^2=M_{\rm irr}^2+\frac{S^2}{4M_{\rm irr}^2}.
\end{equation}
The irreducible mass is related to the surface area of the horizon
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm irr}=\sqrt{A/16\pi}.
\end{equation}
Following the method introduced in \cite{Tacik:2015tja} we also compute the dimensionless spin
of the neutron star in the same way, normalizing it by its ADM mass.

\section{Numerical Methods}
Let us now discuss how we solve these ellitpic equations. We use the
pseduo-spectral multi-grid elliptic solver developped in
\cite{Pfeiffer2003} and enhanced in \cite{FoucartEtAl:2008} to incorporate matter. The computational domain is divided into a number of subdomains. A small cube is placed at the centre of the NS. Overlapping this cube is a spherical shell whose outer boundary deforms to fit the NS surface. These are surrounded by an additional spherical shell. The black hole is represented by two concentric spherical shells. Their inner bounday is required to be an apparent horizon. Three rectangular parallelpipeds surround the axis passing through the centres of the BH and the NS - one between them and one on each side of the objects. An additional eight cylindrical shells are placed around the same axis to cover the intermediate field region. The far-field region is covered by a large spherical shell whose outer boundary is placed at $R=10^{10}$ using an inverse radial mapping. This domain is visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:BhNsDomain}.

\begin{center}

\caption[Visualization of the Bh-Ns domain decomposition.]{Visualization of the Bh-Ns domain decomposition. The black object on the left is the black hole and the orange object on the right is the neutron star. The blue wireframes represent the various cylinders and rectangular parallelpipeds in the domain.}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

All variables (metric and hydrodynamical) decomposed on sets of basis functions on each subdomain. Finite difference schemes are needed for hydrodynamical quantities during evolutions so as to capture shocks, but for initial data spectral methods are suitable and exponentical convergence can be guaranteed. The resolution of each domain is synonymous with the number of colocation points used. The resolution of each domain is chosen by hand at the start of the initial data solve, and then modified several times using an adaptive scheme. To discuss the resolution of the computational domain for the purpose of convergence tests, we will use the notation
\begin{equation}
N^{1/3}=\left(\sum N_i\right)^{1/3},
\end{equation}
where we are summing the colocation points of the all the subdomains. A typical initial data solve might start with, using example numbers, $N^{1/3}\sim 33.3$ and end with $N^{1/3}\sim 80.8$

Construction of initial data begins by choosing values for the free parameters in the problem. In particular, these are
\begin{itemize}
\item The black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$
\item The black hole's target dimensionless spin $\vec{\chi_{\rm BH}}$
\item The neutron star's baryon mass $M_{b}$
\item The neutron star's equation of state 
\item The neutron star's spin vector $\omega^i$
\item The separation between the centres of the BH and NS, $D$
\item The orbital angular velocity $\Omega_0$
\item The initial infall velocity $\dot{a}$
\end{itemize}
We will discuss later how we make the choices of $\Omega_0$ and $\dot{a}$. Additionally, one must make a perscription for the free metric variables. We use maximal slicing $K=0$, and a choice for the conformal metric $\tilde{g}_{ij}$ such that it is Kerr-Schild near the black hole, and flat near the neutron star.

Let's now discuss the algorithm we use the solve for the initial data. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item If on the first resolution step, set $\omega^i=0$, otherwise set to the desired value. This has been found to help with convergence. Additionally, impose a maximum radius out to which to apply $W^i=\epsilon^{ijk}\omega^jr^k$, otherwise low density material at high radius can lead to superluminal velocities.

\item Solve the non-linear XCTS equations for the metric variables
  $X=\left(\beta^i,\Psi,\alpha\Psi\right)$ assuming the matter source
  terms are fixed. Update the metric variables using a relaxation
  scheme
\begin{equation}
X^{n+1}=\lambda X^{*} + (1-\lambda)X^n.
\end{equation}
We use $\lambda=0.3$.

\item Impose equatorial symmetry. This should only be done if both the
  NS and the BH have no spin components in the plane. But if it can be
  imposed, it will speed convergence.

\item Locate the surface of the star. The surface of the star is
  reprsented in terms of spherical harmonics
\begin{equation}
R(\theta,\phi)=\sum c_{lm}Y^{lm}(\theta,\phi)
\end{equation}, and for a polytropic equation of state, the surface
should satisfy $h(R)=1$. 

\item Compute the ADM linear momentum $P_{\rm ADM}$, and if necessary
  move the center of the black hole to zero-out momentum. \red{Add
    more detail here}.

\item If desired, adjust the orbital angular frequency using Eq.~\ref{eq:OmegaDriver}.

\item Get the spin of the BH by evaluating Eq.~\ref{eq:BhSpin}. Then
  modify the parameter $\Omega$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:BhBoundary} to drive
  the black hole spin to the target value.

\item Fix the Euler constant by evaluating the integral
\begin{equation}
M_{B}=\int \rho_0\Psi^6\gamma_ndV
\end{equation}
as a function of the Euler
constant, and use the secant method to drive the baryon mass to the
desired value.

\item Solve the elliptic equations for the velocity potential, $\phi$,
  and update using the same relaxation scheme as described above.

\item Are all equations satisfied to the desired accuracy? If no, go
  to step two, otherwise proceed.

\item Compute the truncation error for the current solution by
  examining the spectral coefficients of the metric variables. If the
  truncation error is too large, adjust the number of grid points and
  return to step 1.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

%\subsection{bla}
%In this section we will demonstrate that we are able to construct robust initial data for generic bh-ns binaries with a spinning neutron star. To begin, we will focus on two axes of the mutli-dimensional parameter space - mass ratio and black-hole spin - while keeping the NS parameters fixed. In particular, we use a neutron star wtih ADM mass, $M_{\rm ADM}=1.4M_{\odot}$, equation of state $P=\kappa\rho_0^\Gamma\left(\Gamma=2.0, \kappa=101.45\right)$ and spin parameter, $\vec{\omega_{\rm NS}}=0.017\hat{z}$, corresponding to a dimensionless spin $\vec{\chi_{\rm NS}}\sim0.4\hat{z}$. The black hole is given a mass, $M_{\rm BH}=qM_{\rm ADM}$ and a dimensionless spin $\vec{\chi_{\rm BH}}=\chi\hat{z}$. In the first initial data sqeuence, we keep $q=7$ fixed, and vary $q=\{0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,0.95\}$. In the second initial data sequence, we keep $\chi=0.9$ fixed and vary $q=\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$. In each case, the BH and the NS are separated by a coordinate distance $D=7.44\left(M_{\rm BH}+M_{\rm ADM}\right)=7.44M$, and have an initial orbital angular velocity $M\Omega_{\rm orb}=0.0413$, with no additional infall velocity ($\dot{a}=0$). We will now focus on a subset of these initial data sets to demonstrate initial data convergence. In particular, the sets with $q=3$, $q=5$, $q=10$, $\chi=0$, $\chi=0.5$, $\chi=0.95$.



\subsection{Initial Data Set Parameters}
Let us begin by discussing the parameters for the initial data sets to be discussed in this work. As a starting point, we use the six BH-NS configurations described in Table 1 of \cite{Foucart:2013a}. All binaries have a mass ratio $q=7$ and a black hole spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH}=0.9$. The neutron star in each binary has an ADM mass of $1.4M_{\odot}$. In practice, this means that is fixed to have the same baryon mass as that of an isolated, non-spinning neutron star with ADM mass $1.4M_{\odot}$. There are three different NS equations of state used. They are all polytropic equations of state ($P=\kappa\rho^\Gamma$) with $\Gamma=2$, but vary in terms of $\kappa$, resulting in different neutron star compactnesses. The values of $\kappa$ used are $84.28$, $92.12$, $101.45$, which result in compactnesses, respectively, of $0.170$, $0.156$, $0.144$, for non-spinning neutron stars with ADM Mass $1.4M_{\odot}$. We will use the notation $R12$, $R13$ and $R14$ to refer to these configurations, respectively. The $R12$ and $R13$ configurations are only set with the black hole spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum. For $R14$, we also create data sets with the black hole spin misaligned by $20^{\circ}$, $40^{\circ}$ and $60^{\circ}$. The non-parallel part of the black hole spin is set parallel to the $\hat{x}$ axis. In each case the initial separation between the black hole and the neutron star is $D=7.44M$. The initial infall velocity parameter $\dot{a}$ is set to $0$. The orbital angular velocity is the same as in \cite{Foucart:2013a} and is indicated in table~\ref{tab:FullBHNSParameters}.

The above constitutes 6 different configurations. For each of these 6
configurations, we choose an additional 6 configurations of neutron
star spins (thus 36 total configurations). In particular we choose
three directions - aligned with the orbital angular momentum,
anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and completley in the
orbital plane, parallel to the $\hat{x}$ direction. For each of these
3 directions, we use a ``high-spin'' and a ``low-spin''. These are
typically $\chi_{NS}\sim 0.4$ and $\chi_{\rm NS}\sim 0.1$,
respectively. In our naming notation, we use a large arrow
($\Uparrow$)  for the ``high-spin'' configurations and a small arrow
($\uparrow$) for the ``low-spin'', with the direction of the arrow
indicating the direction of the NS spin vector. The full parameters of
the initial data sets are summarized in Table
~\ref{tab:FullBHNSParameters}. In particular, the name of the run using the naming convention discussed,
the black hole spin direction, the baryon mass of the neutron star, the orbital angular velocity of the system,
the approximate number of orbits before merger, the neutron star spin vector $\vec{\omega}$, and the measured dimensionless
spin of the neutron star. Note that the number of orbits is taken from \cite{Foucart:2013a}, and doesn't account for the neutron star
spin. Note also since "merger" is defined by the maximum amplitude of the gravitaitonal waveform, this quantity isn't perfectly well-defined
for precessing binaries.

\caption[Initial data set parameters for series of 36 Bh-Ns initial data sets.]{\label{tab:FullBHNSParameters}Full set of parameters of the 36 sets of initial data we've created using the results of
\cite{Foucart:2013a} as the starting point.}
\end{longtable}

In addition to these parameters, we consider several other sequences
of Bh-Ns data sets to verify the robustness of the solutions across
the whole parameter space. First, we consider a sequence of where we vary the neutron star spin from
$\chi_{\rm NS}=0$ to $\chi_{\rm NS}\sim0.7$, keeping it aligned with the orbital angular momentum. In these initial data sets, the other binary parameters are the same
as in the {\tt R14i0} runs. Namely, the neutron star mass, equation of state, black hole mass, black hole spin, initial separation and orbital angular frequency.

Next, we consider a sequence of runs where we vary the black hole spin from $\chi_{\rm BH}=0$ to $\chi_{\rm BH}=0.99$. Similarly, the other binary parameters are the same as in the {\tt R14i0$\Uparrow$} run.

Finally, we consider a sequence of runs where we vary the mass ratio from $q=2$ to $q=10$. In these runs the other binary parameters are the same as in the {\tt R14i0$\Uparrow$} run. In particular, the orbital parameters $M\Omega$ and $D/M$ are constant. While not the most accurate way of choosing these parameters, it is a simple method that is sufficient for our purposes.

To assess the accuracy of this approximation, we can look at Eq.228 of \cite{Blanchet2006}:
\begin{equation}
\Omega^2=\frac{Gm}{r^3}\left(1+(-3+\nu)\gamma+\left(6+\frac{41}{4}\nu+\nu^2\right)\gamma^2+...\right)
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the symmetric mass ratio, $\nu=\frac{q}{(1+q)^2}$, and $\gamma=Gm/rc^2$. Keeping $r$ and $m$ constant, this quantity ($m\Omega$) varies by approximately 3\% in the mass ratio range we consider.
Thus, while this approximation will induce a small eccentricity of a similar order, it's not a large enough difference to invalidate our results.

Figure~\ref{fig:3dparam} summarizes all the initial data sets along the axes of $\chi_{\rm NS}$, $\chi_{\rm BH}$ and $q$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Convergence of the Initial Data Solver}
To assess the convergence of the initial data solver we will begin by looking at the convergence of the iterative part of the solver. That is, the convergence of steps 1-10 in the iterative procedure
described above. To assess the convergence we will focus on one particular initial data set - namely the {\tt R14i60$\Uparrow$} initial data set. 

We begin by looking at the convergence of the Euler constant, $C$. In figure~\ref{Fig:EulerConv} we plot the absolute difference in $C$ between neighbouring iterations for the eight
different resolutions used in the initial data solve. In our notation, {\tt R1} is the first resolution, {\tt R2} is the second, etc. In the figure we see that at a given resolution these differences
seem to decrease exponentially with iteration. Meanwhile the differences also decrease with increasing resolution. This all shows that the initial data solver is working as it should. Note that although we've only shown
this plot for the {\tt R14i60$\Uparrow$} inital data set, we find similar results for all the other initial data sets we consider.


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{chap4/EulerConv}
\caption[Convergence of the Euler constant for the {\tt R14160$\Uparrow$}]{\label{Fig:EulerConv}
Absolute difference between neighbouring iterations of the Euler constant for the {\tt R14i160$\Uparrow$} initial data set. The eight curves {\tt R1}-{\tt R8} are the eight different resolutions
used in the initial data solve.}
\end{figure}

Next, we will look at the properties of the black hole to verify that they convergence as expected in the presence of a spinning neutron star. Again, we will focus on the {\tt R14i60$\Uparrow$} run, and look at the black hole spin parameter $a=J/M=M\chi$, which is controlled by the parameter $\Omega_j^{\rm BH}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:BhBoundary3}. The target values are
\begin{eqnarray}
a&=&\chi_{\rm BH}M_{\rm BH}\\
&=&q\chi_{\rm BH}M_{\rm NS}^{\rm ADM}\\
a_x&=&q\chi_{\rm BH}(\sin60^{\circ})M_{\rm NS}^{\rm ADM}\\
a_z&=&q\chi_{\rm BH}(\cos60^{\circ})M_{\rm NS}^{\rm ADM}
\end{eqnarray}
We also look at the irreducible mass of the black hole, $M_{\rm irr}$. It is controlled by the size of the excision surface, and satisfies the relation
\begin{eqnarray}
M_{\rm BH}^{\rm irr}&=&\sqrt{\frac{A_{\rm AH}}{16\pi}}\\
(M_{\rm BH}^{\rm ADM})^2\left((M_{\rm BH}^{\rm irr})^2-\frac{a^2}{4}\right)&=&(M_{\rm BH}^{\rm irr})^4
\end{eqnarray}

In figure~\ref{Fig:BHSpinConv} we plot the fractional difference between the measured black hole spin and the target value, for both the x and z directions, as well as the fractional difference between
the measured black hole irreducible mass and the target value. The difference is plotted as a funciton of iteration, for four different resolutions. Note that the previous plot had eight different resolutions, while this one only has four. This is because the black hole spin is only computed for the first four resolutions - afterwards it is no longer solved for or measured. We note that in general we see a decrease in this difference with iteration, especially at the first resolution, therefore showing that the iterative solver is correctly driving the the black hole properties to the target values.
We also note that this difference decrease with resolution, and that we are able to achieve an accuracy of about $10^{-5}$ in the BH spin and mass.

the four different resolutions at which the black hole spin is measured. The solid curves are for the $\hat{x}$ component of the BH spin, the dashed curves for the $\hat{z}$ component of the BH spin, and
the dotted curves are for the irreducible mass of the BH.}
\end{figure}

Having now established the convergence of the iterative procedure, we turn now to establish the convergence with resolution of the global properties of the solution.
We begin by looking at the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints for the {\tt R14i160$\Uparrow$} initial data set.
The Hamiltonian constraint is computed as
\begin{equation}
H=||\frac{R_{\psi}}{8\psi^5}||
\end{equation}
where $R_{\psi}$ is the residual of Eq.~\ref{eq:XCTS-ConformalFactor}
and $||$ represents the $L2$ norm over the computational
domain. Similarly, the momentum constraint is computed as
\begin{equation}
M = ||\frac{R_{\beta}}{2\alpha\Psi^4}||
\end{equation}
where $R_{\beta}$ is the residual of Eq.~\ref{eq:XCTS-Shift}.
The constraints for this ID set are shown in figure~\ref{fig:HamMom}. We find exponential convergence in the constraints, as expected for spectral methods. The most notable feature
is that at {\rm R2} the constraints are higher than would be expected from the trend, otherwise. This is because the neutron star spin is only "turned on" at {\rm R2}, and so an additional amount of
solver time is needed to adjust to this change.
